Hi again,
Yesterday I wrote the test automation script in PyCharm IDE to automate the new user account registration, which I have added to this GitHub folder
However, I have not automated all the webelements in the 'Recap' page as I do not have a valid creditc card from a German bank
You may run this code in PyCharm IDE by changing the path of the Google Chrome browser driver.
Thank you.
