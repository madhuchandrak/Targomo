Greetings of the day!
I have used my email address madhuchandra332019@gmail.com with the password Test@031020194 to login during the test automation
I have chosen "Test@031020195" to be set as a new password
Once the code is run, the password would change
Please update the new password in the code and also change the new password to be set before running the code again
I wish I had more time to add the HTML report generating code so that the test reports can be viewed in the browser in HTML format
Please contact me for further queries, if any.
Thank you. Have a nice day!
